# :mage_man: Hit Point Counter
A hit point counter for tabletop RPGs and board games

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/xanderbylo/hit-point-counter) 

The project was inspired by the [Passenger Counter](https://scrimba.com/playlist/pY5b7sQ) project on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). 

I wanted to redesign and repurpose the app so users are able to increment and decrement their number of hit points depending on what they roll in the game.
